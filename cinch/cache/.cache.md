cinch - about the cache folder
==============================

This folder is where all cached files are stored on the server. A separate cache file is created for each combination of JS/CSS files and when any of the query settings are changed.

In order to prevent this folder from being overloaded on a busy development server, the cache is cleared about once a month.
