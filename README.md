repeaterrrr
===========

repeaterrrr lets you create no-frills timers for any activity that requires keeping track of time in regular intervals.

Plus, all your timer settings are stored in the URL, so it's easy to create, customize and share.

*NOTE: The PHP file that handles XHR requests for the bit.ly API has been excluded from the repo to keep the API key secret.*
